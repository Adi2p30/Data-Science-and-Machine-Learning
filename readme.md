# Welcome! ðŸ˜€
This repository is a showcase of my skills and projects in the fields of machine learning and data science.

You will find a variety of projects that demonstrate my ability to work with machine learning algorithms, data visualization techniques, and data analysis tools.

Some of the projects you will find in this repository include:
A machine learning model that predicts housing prices based on a variety of features
Walkthroughs on multiple data visualization libraries.
